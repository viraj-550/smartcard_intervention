    "text": "Introduction\nDeveloping countries allocate a significant portion of their annual budget to social assistance programs, but most of these funds fail to reach their intended recipients due to ineﬀiciencies resulting from leakages and corruption. In 2016, India allocated $70 billion to social assistance programs (Govt. of India 2017), but historical estimates suggest that around 51% of these funds were lost due to inadequate delivery systems (Imbert, Clement, and John Papp. 2016; Govt of India 2005). One potential solution to improve assistance delivery is the implementation of digital payment systems that directly deposit government funds into the beneficiaries’ bank accounts, thereby reducing bureaucracy. To enhance the system’s security, biometric authentication can be employed. In 2006, the state government of Andhra Pradesh (GoAP) introduced the Smartcard system, a large-scale biometric payments system, to enhance the delivery of two major social welfare programs: the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) and Social Security Pensions (SSP). NREGS guarantees 100 days of wage employment per year to every rural household, while SSP provides payments to elderly and disabled individuals below the poverty line. However, due to implementation issues, the program was initially shut down. In 2010, J-PAL South Asia partnered with GoAP and relaunched the program in eight districts of Andhra Pradesh. The objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Smartcard system by running a large-scale randomized evaluation involving 8,000 households. The program aimed to improve governance by reducing corruption and enhancing eﬀiciency using biometric authentication and secure digital payment systems. This initiative increased access to governmental benefits for citizens, and reduced costs associated with manual processes and fraud. Building upon this previous work, our pre-registered study proposes to expand the bio- metric smartcard program introduced by Andhra Pradesh to three other Indian states using synthetic data. The expanded program aims to fully implement the biometric smartcard payment system in these states, specifically targeting the NREGS welfare program. Our plan involves equipping all panchayats (village councils) in the three states with payment technology and converting local Point of Service (PoS) locations into Smartcard facilities where all payments will be processed through the Smartcard system. If beneficiaries are not enrolled in the program, they will continue to receive payments in cash, similar to the previous system. Workers can enroll in the program, register their biometric information, and receive new Smartcards at designated stations. The PoS devices will store the biomet- ric information of all enrolled workers locally, facilitating transaction verification without internet access. The primary goal of this paper is to evaluate the impact of the Smartcard program on governance. Good governance ensures the eﬀicient and equitable delivery of governmental processes, promoting public welfare. We anticipate a reduction in leakages, corruption, and wait times for the program’s beneficiaries. These improvements are expected to enhance overall eﬀiciency, increase earnings, and foster greater trust in government welfare measures. To evaluate the program’s impact on system leakages, wait times, and corruption, we employ an instrumental variable design. Our study involves randomly selecting 500 panchay- ats from the three states as a representative sample. Following program implementation, we randomly select 250 out of the 500 sample panchayats as the promotion locations. All house- holds previously enrolled in the NREGS program will receive a promotion and information on enrolling in the Smartcard program. Subsequently, we conduct weekly surveys in all 500 panchayats over four weeks, gathering data on personal characteristics, leakages, wait times, and corruption events. By utilizing randomized promotion as a valid instrument, we find that the Smartcard intervention leads to a reduction in leakages, wait times and corruption."

    "text": "We use a mix of administrative and survey data to estimate the causal link between the program and the outcomes of interest. We conduct weekly survey for a 4-week period to measure the household level weekly payments received, time spent (in minutes) at the PoS, days between work is completed and payment is received, and corruption incidences. We compare the weekly payments received to the official disbursement data to estimate the household level leakage in the system, the amount lost in inefficiencies or corruptions. Alongside, we collect data on household characteristics like number of children, number of females in the household, household literacy rate, religion, assets like farmland, and household head age and gender."

    "text": "The program theory is that biometric authentication and secure payment systems can improve governance by reducing leakages in the delivery systems and reducing payment delays without adversely affecting program access.\nThe theory, based on previous research (World Bank 2003; Pritchett 2010, Reinikka and Svensson 2004; Programme Evaluation Organisation 2005; Niehaus and Sukhtankar 2013b) assumes that corruption and leakages are prevalent in government services in developing countries, leading to ineﬀiciencies in assistance delivery systems. By implementing biometric authentication and secure payment systems, the government can ensure that the correct individuals receive the correct payments and services. The Smartcards intervention has a two-fold effect. First, it changes the institutions responsible for managing the funds by eliminating a few intermediaries and moves the point of payment closer to the recipient. Second, it introduces biometric authentication which facilities transparency in the system by providing a secure, tamperproof record of who has received services and payments. This can help to reduce corruption and increase accountability.\nSimilar to Muralidharan et al. 2016, we consider two main dimensions of impact: payment logistics, and leakages. We also consider multiple scenarios surrounding each dimension. First, the payment logistics could improve or worsen. It could naturally improve the system by moving the point of payment closer to the village, or the program could slow down the process due to technical problems like malfunctioning authentication devices or absence of technical staff. Improving payment logistics will affect the wait times of beneficiaries to access the funds. Secondly, the program could reduce or fail to reduce leakages. Theoretically, smartcards should reduce payments to ghost recipients and forbid oﬀicials to collect payments in the name of real beneficiaries as the beneficiaries must be present to pass the biometric test. But there could be technical loopholes in the payment architecture that could disprove the claim of an absolute secure system. Moreover, the assistance programs’ access could improve or suffer. In case of NREGS, local oﬀicers decide projects and generate employment. Eliminating opportunities to seek rent may disincentivize oﬀicials and they might reduce access. On the other hand, the NREGS funds would directly go towards to the development projects that were originally intended thus creating rural assets and generating more employment.\n\n\n\nSmartcard Program Impact Theory Graph"

    "text": "We use an instrumental variable design to identify the causal link between the smartcard program and outcomes like leakages, wait times and corruption. The NREGS program has a universal access and hence it fair to provide universal access to the smartcard program that facilitates the NREGS welfare program. In this scenario, we suspect that households that enroll into the smartcard intervention are fundamentally different than the households that do not enroll. For example, poor households with fewer job opportunities or literate households can be more likely to enroll into the program. There exists a host of household and geographic characteristics that influence enrollment into the program and the outcomes. Due to limitations, we cannot measure every variable. In this scenario, we use randomized promotion as an instrumental variable.\nThe instrumental variable approach isolates the causal effect of the program on the outcome by using the variation in the treatment induced by the instrument. By comparing the outcomes of households who received treatment through the instrument with those who did not receive treatment through the instrument, we can estimate the causal effect of the program on the outcomes of choice.\nSpecifically, the randomized promotion ensures that the distribution of observable and unobservable characteristics between the treatment and control groups is balanced, reducing the potential for selection bias. Furthermore, the instrumental variable approach addresses endogeneity by focusing on the exogenous variation in the randomized promotion, rather than the endogenous relationship between the program and outcomes, thus isolating the causal effect of the program on the outcomes of interest. This approach allows us to obtain an unbiased estimate of the causal effect of the program, even in the presence of selection bias and endogeneity.\nOur identification strategy takes the form of two-staged least squares (2SLS) instrumental variable. In the first stage, we estimate the effect of randomized promotion on the endogenous smartcard enrollment. Hence, we estimate:\n\\[\n\\text{Smartcard}= \\beta_{0} + \\beta \\text{Promotion} + \\gamma X + u\n\\] Where \\(\\text{Smartcard}\\) is a binary indicator of whether a household enrolled into the program, and \\(X\\) is a vector of covariates.\nThe general form of the second stage least squares is as follows: \\[\n\\text{Outcome}_i =  \\beta_{0_i} + \\beta_i \\hat{\\text{Smartcard}} + \\gamma_i X + \\epsilon_i\n\\]\nWhere \\(\\text{Outcome }_i = \\{\\text{Leakage}, \\text{Queue Wait Time }, \\text{Payment Delay}, \\text{Corruption} \\}\\)\nOverall, the instrumental variable approach using randomized promotion provides a rigorous and credible method for estimating the causal effects of the smartcard program on the outcomes of interest, while also addressing potential issues of selection bias and endogeneity.\nA DAG for the outcome is as follows:"

    "text": "Based on the first stage model, we see that there is a strong relationship between instrument (randomized promotion) and smartcard enrollment. The randomized promotion is positively correlated with smartcard enrollment. Moreover, the joint F-statistic of the model is 8608 with a p-value less than 0.01. We can reject the hypothesis that the instrument is weak. We can conclude that the instrument is relevant. Since the promotion panchayats are selected through a randomized process, the instrument is not correlated with any observable or unobservable characteristics of households or location. The instrument satisfies exogeneity. Lastly, there is a clear causal mechanism between the randomized promotion and the outcomes of interest. A promotion can only cause leakages, wait times, and corruption to increase or decrease only if a household enrolls into the smartcard program after receiving the promotion. Hence, the instrument satisfies exclusion.\n\n\n\nWe can see that the smartcard intervention causes a decrease in leakages by 45.3 rupees for compliers. Moreover, wait time in queue is reduced by 10 minutes. Complier households received payment 3 days earlier, on average, as compared to non-compliers. Lastly, corruption decreased by 0.725 incidences. All estimates are statistically significant at 1% level. These results reinforce our expectations that the smartcard intervention would negatively affect leakage, wait times and corruption faced by the rural workers.\n\n\n\nThe Weak Instruments test is as follows:\nThe p-value for the test is negligible. Hence we can reject the null hypothesis that our instrument is weak."
