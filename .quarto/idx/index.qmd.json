In 2016, India allocated $70 billion to social assistance programs (Govt. of India 2017), but historical estimates suggest that around 51% of these funds were lost due to inadequate delivery systems (Imbert, Clement, and John Papp. 2016; Govt of India 2005). One potential solution to improve assistance delivery is the implementation of digital payment systems that directly deposit government funds into the beneficiaries’ bank accounts, thereby reducing bureaucracy. To enhance the system’s security, biometric authentication can be employed.\nIn 2006, the state government of Andhra Pradesh (GoAP) introduced the Smartcard system, a large-scale biometric payments system, to enhance the delivery of two major social welfare programs: the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) and Social Security Pensions (SSP). NREGS guarantees 100 days of wage employment per year to every rural household, while SSP provides payments to elderly and disabled individuals below the poverty line. However, due to implementation issues, the program was initially shut down. In 2010, J-PAL South Asia partnered with GoAP and relaunched the program in eight districts of Andhra Pradesh. The objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Smartcard system by running a large-scale randomized evaluation involving 8,000 households. The program aimed to improve governance by reducing corruption and enhancing eﬀiciency using biometric authentication and secure digital payment systems. This initiative increased access to governmental benefits for citizens, and reduced costs associated with manual processes and fraud.\nBuilding upon this previous work, our pre-registered study proposes to expand the bio- metric smartcard program introduced by Andhra Pradesh to three other Indian states using synthetic data. The expanded program aims to fully implement the biometric smartcard payment system in these states, specifically targeting the NREGS welfare program. Our plan involves equipping all panchayats (village councils) in the three states with payment technology and converting local Point of Service (PoS) locations into Smartcard facilities where all payments will be processed through the Smartcard system. If beneficiaries are not enrolled in the program, they will continue to receive payments in cash, similar to the previous system. Workers can enroll in the program, register their biometric information, and receive new Smartcards at designated stations. The PoS devices will store the biomet- ric information of all enrolled workers locally, facilitating transaction verification without internet access.\nThe primary goal of this paper is to evaluate the impact of the Smartcard program on governance. Good governance ensures the eﬀicient and equitable delivery of governmental processes, promoting public welfare. We anticipate a reduction in leakages, corruption, and wait times for the program’s beneficiaries. These improvements are expected to enhance overall eﬀiciency, increase earnings, and foster greater trust in government welfare measures.\nTo evaluate the program’s impact on system leakages, wait times, and corruption, we employ an instrumental variable design. Our study involves randomly selecting 500 panchay- ats from the three states as a representative sample. Following program implementation, we randomly select 250 out of the 500 sample panchayats as the promotion locations. All house- holds previously enrolled in the NREGS program will receive a promotion and information on enrolling in the Smartcard program. Subsequently, we conduct weekly surveys in all 500 panchayats over four weeks, gathering data on personal characteristics, leakages, wait times, and corruption events. By utilizing randomized promotion as a valid instrument, we find that the Smartcard intervention leads to a reduction in leakages, wait times and corruption.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","editor":"visual","theme":"minty","title":"Smartcard Intervention Impact Evaluation","author":"Viraj R.
