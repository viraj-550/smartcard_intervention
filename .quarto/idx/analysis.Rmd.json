The randomized promotion is positively correlated with smartcard enrollment. Moreover, the joint F-statistic of the model is 8608 with a p-value less than 0.01. We can reject the hypothesis that the instrument is weak. We can conclude that the instrument is relevant. Since the promotion panchayats are selected through a randomized process, the instrument is not correlated with any observable or unobservable characteristics of households or location. The instrument satisfies exogeneity. Lastly, there is a clear causal mechanism between the randomized promotion and the outcomes of interest. A promotion can only cause leakages, wait times, and corruption to increase or decrease only if a household enrolls into the smartcard program after receiving the promotion. Hence, the instrument satisfies exclusion. \n\n\n## 2SLS Estimation\n\n\nWe can see that the smartcard intervention causes a decrease in leakages by 45.3 rupees for compliers. Moreover, wait time in queue is reduced by 10 minutes. Complier households received payment 3 days earlier, on average, as compared to non-compliers. Lastly, corruption decreased by 0.725 incidences. All estimates are statistically significant at 1% level. These results reinforce our expectations that the smartcard intervention would negatively affect leakage, wait times and corruption faced by the rural workers. \n\n## Robustness Checks\n\nThe Weak Instruments test is as follows:\n\nThe p-value for the test is negligible. Hence we can reject the null hypothesis that our instrument is weak. \n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":{"html_document":{"code_folding":"hide"}},"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"analysis.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","editor":"visual","theme":"minty","title":"Analysis","author":"Viraj R.
